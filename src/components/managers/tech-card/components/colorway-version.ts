// THE OPTIMISTIC LOCK, READ AT COMMIT TIME — never at render time. Both colourway writes echo the
// ref's lockVersion, which IS the shared tech_card.lock_version. Under one staged save the card body
// commits first (COMMIT_ORDER 0) and bumps that version, and so does every colourway write queued
// ahead of this one. A version captured when this panel rendered is therefore already stale by the
// time the header reaches it, and the save would 409 against its own card body. So re-read it
// immediately before each write — the same move the size chart makes with GetStyleSizeChart.
